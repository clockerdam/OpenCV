summary: I am a lawyer, avidly interested in providing solutions to social issues
  faced in the world. To this end, I have developed certain community development
  projects, one of which is Raise a Kid, a project aimed at providing free basic and
  quality education for underprivileged children in Iwaya, Lagos. I have also volunteered
  for projects aimed at the realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development
  Goals, within and outside Nigeria. I started the Students Spotlights Series podcast,
  alongside my friend Erioluwa Adeyinka, which is an interview series that seeks to
  inspire others, particularly the student population, through the stories of other
  students or very recent graduates, who can be said to have done exceptionally well
  in certain spheres of life, whilst being students. The interviews take listeners
  through the journeys of certain pacesetters, to understand what they do/did that
  worked, certain challenges they faced and how they were able to navigate through.
  On many days when I am not volunteering to solve social problems or actively seeking
  opportunities for my development, I spend time writing on topics that interest me.
