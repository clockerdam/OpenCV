summary: With a Ph.D. in data science and more than five years of working in data
  science and analytical roles, I have significant experience in creating actionable
  insights and data-driven solutions through research, experimentation, data analysis,
  and developing advanced analytical and machine learning models. I collaborated with
  different teams and managed cross- functional projects to provide innovative solutions
  to challenging problems and advise executives on operations, product, marketing,
  and customer experience strategies.
