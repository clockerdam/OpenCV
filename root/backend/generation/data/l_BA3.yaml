  description: Romulus Capital is a lead investor in early-stage Seed & Series A startups
    in B2B enterprise and commercialization of science across different verticals.
    We focus on company-building, rather than betting on companies. Rather than investing
    in dozens of startups, we go all-in on a few companies a year on capital, team
    recruitment, customer introductions, and GTM strategy. Our firm is unique combination
    of young and entrepreneurial, yet established with 3 funds with ~$200M AUM. We
    pride ourselves as a small, hungry team that brings the same level of grit and
    hustle as our founders.

- company: Stafford Capital Partners
  description: I had sole responsibility for designing, building, and maintaining
    a database which identified potential deals. Using large downloads of market-wide
    data, I developed a ranking system, weighting relevant data points about each
    asset, fund, or fund manager. I also created a company-wide Geographic Information
    System which mapped the location of all of the firm's assets. These tasks required
    a high level of accuracy, judgement, and attention to detail. In addition, I met
    with software vendors, participated in investor meetings, and presented to senior
    management.
