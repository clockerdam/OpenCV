  description: In my research, I design experiments, conduct exploratory data analysis,
    apply statistical methods, and develop Machine Learning models to study human
    behaviors and to produce results with practical insights of value in a business
    context. Built an ML pipeline to predict online review effectiveness through personalization
    and feature engineering with NLP (Python). Applied NLP to extract new features
    through sentiment analysis and topic modeling (NLTK & Gensim). Developed XGBoost,
    Random Forest, and Poisson Regression (log-linear) models to predict customers
    decision. Developed and enhanced time series and RNN models of sequential human
    decisions through behavioral modeling (Python). Built and tuned ARIMA and LSTM
    models using new behavioral features and improved prediction RMSE by 5.8% (statsmodels
    & sklearn & keras). Developed a stock market portfolio recommender model using
    cluster analysis and association rule mining (R & SQL).
