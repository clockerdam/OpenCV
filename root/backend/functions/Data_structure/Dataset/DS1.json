    "Summary": "Background in artificial intelligence, machine learning, technology, computer vision, computational neuroscience, product management, startups, entrepreneurship and tech/career mentorship. I am passionate about finding patterns and making predictions from empirical data that not only revolutionize the day-to-day work process but also help humanity overcome its most critical challenges such as climate change, healthcare challenges and the problem of lack of diversity and inclusion within technology.I will soon be joining Adage AB as a consultant where I will work on data science and data engineering projects to help companies with their data and analytics transformation. Previously, I worked as the head of AI at Earthbanc where she was advocating for innovation in the fight against Climate Change using her knowledge of tech and AI. I worked on creating a dynamic, reliable and accessible Carbon Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) model which would help make the MRV service accessible to landowners with a small area of land (patent-pending). My ultimate vision is to create an inclusive international AI community that extends access to knowledge and resources to more diverse groups such as women, the LGBTQ+ community and the youth, and I am working on numerous projects and initiatives to further this vision.",
