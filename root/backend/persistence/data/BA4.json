    "summary": "I am a lawyer, avidly interested in providing solutions to social issues faced in the world. To this end, I have developed certain community development projects, one of which is Raise a Kid, a project aimed at providing free basic and quality education for underprivileged children in Iwaya, Lagos. I have also volunteered for projects aimed at the realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, within and outside Nigeria. I started the Students Spotlights Series podcast, alongside my friend Erioluwa Adeyinka, which is an interview series that seeks to inspire others, particularly the student population, through the stories of other students or very recent graduates, who can be said to have done exceptionally well in certain spheres of life, whilst being students. The interviews take listeners through the journeys of certain pacesetters, to understand what they do/did that worked, certain challenges they faced and how they were able to navigate through. On many days when I am not volunteering to solve social problems or actively seeking opportunities for my development, I spend time writing on topics that interest me.",
