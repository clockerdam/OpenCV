    "summary": "Currently, I am working on my Ph.D. at Malardalen University. The focus of my research is using ML/AI technologies for requirements engineering. For almost two years, I worked as Software Engineer at SynergySuite. My main focus was improving and developing applications using Java Enterprise and Java Spring framework. I was born in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, where I have finished primary and high school, both with honors. For three years, I have studied at the Faculty of Information Technology at University Mediterranean. I finished my undergraduate studies with an average GPA of 9.26/10. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member and a president of the Student Union. I was an awardee in various competitions and by the University because I was among the top 5% of students in the generation. In 2018, I got the Erasmus ICM scholarship and the opportunity to finish my Master's studies at Mälardalen University in Västerås, Sweden. My thesis project was done in collaboration with Bombardier Transportation. The focus of the thesis was on developing test script design supporting reusability, maintainability, and review process.",
