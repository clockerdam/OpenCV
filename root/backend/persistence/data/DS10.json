    "summary": "With a Ph.D. in data science and more than five years of working in data science and analytical roles, I have significant experience in creating actionable insights and data-driven solutions through research, experimentation, data analysis, and developing advanced analytical and machine learning models. I deployed end-to-end machine learning solutions and decision support systems to improve performance across the enterprise. I improved product-market fit and customer usage by executing user experience experiments like A/B testing. I collaborated with different teams and managed cross- functional projects to provide innovative solutions to challenging problems, recommend opportunities for business growth, create value for stakeholders, and advise executives on operations, product, marketing, and customer experience strategies. I am passionate about learning while helping businesses to grow.",
